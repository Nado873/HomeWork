                    ​
                    
                    We had been living and working in London for nearly 15 years. We always spent our holiday time travelling the world visiting 49 countries from every continent except Antartica. We love to travel and experience new things. We were growing restless and a little jaded with London life. We have been looking around the world at opportunities but we have always been drawn back to Scandinavia. 
                    
                    During one trip to Lapland we got engaged under the Northern Lights. It was our first time seeing them and they always have special meaning for us when they appear. There is something quite magical and addictive about the Aurora and we always feel blessed when we see them. 
                    
                    When we arrived in Levi for a holiday we fell in love immediately. We knew we had to find a way to be here in Lapland under the Northern Lights permanently. It felt like home...
                    
                     
                    
                    ... In 2017 we took the big decision to sell up, pack the car and start a new life here in the Arctic. 
                    
                    ​
                    
                    Finnish Lapland is wonderful place with the cleanest air and the happiest people in the world. Here in Lapland there is just 0.8 people per square kilometre. That means you can really feel that connection with unspoilt nature. When out walking Gooseberry our Parsons Russell Terrier we will often bump in to wildlife such as Reindeer and Moose but as yet we have not seen an Elf... outside Santa's Office that is... It's just 160km away! 
                    
                    ​
                    
                    Today we offer visitors to Lapland the chance to sample it's beauty and traditions in several ways.

    <p> Unique Spaces to Stay

​

Located in the ancient Taiga Forest we have created Foxfires, our take on Nordic boutique accommodation  Made up of two individually furnished private guest rooms each with uniquely designed eu-suite bathroom. We are located just 8 minutes drive from the centre of Levi and just 300m from the nearest ski slopes, cross country ski route and walking / biking trails. 

​

Our rooms make the most of our forest location with large floor to ceiling windows that allow you to feel at one with nature. In the evening you might be lucky to see the Aurora overhead. 

 

The rooms are individually designed. We have taken inspiration from Scandinavian interior design and Nordic nature to craft uniquely designed furniture that we feel reflects our location here in the Arctic. 

 

Because of our love of animals, we are naming our rooms after Arctic wildlife. Our first two rooms are inspired by the Polar Bear and the Wolf. A percentage of the profit from Foxfires will be donated to Arctic wildlife conservation charities such as Polar Bears International and the World Wildlife Fund. 

 

The inclusive breakfast is served in our large open plan breakfast space. With five meter high floor to ceiling windows at both ends of the room you can be in the forest whist warm and cozy by the fire enjoying a freshly prepared breakfast inspired by Nordic cuisine and flavoured with Lappish delicacies.

                <th>It all began in 1976, when we received the keys to the legendary Cipriani, a Belmond hotel in Venice. A year later we began collecting the carriages for the Venice Simplon-Orient-Express, which launched in 1982 to whisk intrepid travellers to La Serenissima in style.

                    Belmond joined LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton in April 2019, reinforcing our place among the international leaders in luxury. For over 40 years we have followed our pioneering spirit and passion for authenticity to create and uncover some of the world’s greatest travel adventures. Today, our collection includes one-of-a-kind hotels, trains, river cruises and safari lodges in stunning destinations across the globe. Each has an incredible story to tell.</th>

            We aim to tread lightly and indeed make a positive contribution to the many destinations where we operate. We are also strongly aware of our responsibility towards natural resources and the environment, especially at locations close to World Heritage Sites.

All our hotels, trains and river cruises run initiatives to support the places and people that surround them. As part of our “Think Global, Act Local” approach we:

Purchase as much food as possible from sustainable sources
Run and support educational programmes
Follow sustainable practices to reduce the impact of our operations on the environment and to ensure energy efficiency
Among our many initiatives, the food and beverage operations of the majority of Belmond’s hotels, trains and river cruises are assessed by the UK-based Sustainable Restaurant Association. Belmond is the first global    luxury hospitality brand to have undertaken this ongoing third party testing.
